The Post list Component will render the array list of posts as mentioned earlier. We can use this list both in the NewsFeed and Profile component.

The Post list component will iterate thru list of post passed to it as props from the NewsFeed or the Profile component and pass the data of each post to the Post Component, that will then render the details of the post.

The post list component also passes the removeUpdate method as props so that when a post is been removed the state updates as well across each component
